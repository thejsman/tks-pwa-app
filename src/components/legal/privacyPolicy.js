              <p>
                Though we make every effort to preserve the user privacy, we may
                need to disclose personal information when required by law
                wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is
                necessary to comply with an appropriate law enforcement
                investigation, current judicial proceeding, a court order or
                legal process served on our APP, Web Site, or as required by
                law.
              </p>
              <p>GENERAL DESCRIPTION</p>
              <p>
                {appDomain} collects a Person's Name, Mailing Address, Phone
                Number and E-mail Address. This information is requested during
                the submission of a query by an agency from or to us and is used
                to deliver services that the user/agency has requested.
              </p>
              <p>NORMAL BROWSING</p>
              <p>
                As with many websites, we collect certain information. When you
                browse, read, or download information from {appDomain}, data is
                collected by {appDomain} including but not limited to your IP
                address, URL request, browser type, and date and time of your
                request. Additionally, we collect the IP addresses of visitors,
                time of access, browser type, and web pages visited. This is
                primarily done for a smooth transition of the user and to adhere
                to the security parameters of the {appDomain} itself. We do not
                collect any other information without your knowledge and
                permission.
              </p>
              <p>INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE</p>
              <p>
                {appDomain} requests personally identifiable information when
                you seek a query from the Contact Us Tab in the {appDomain} and
                is subject to the Terms of Use as mentioned on such site. (Such
                information may be used or requested to perform research,
                improve usability of the site, administer mailing lists or
                online communities or other activities related) to {appDomain}{" "}
                services. This information may include, but is not limited to,
                person&rsquo;s names, email addresses, location.

              <p>DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</p>
              <p>
                Available log records and all data stored on our servers may be
                accessed by our system administrators. In the event that we are
                required by law (including a court order) to disclose the
                information you submit. We, however, prefer to independently
                object to overly broad requests for access to information about
                users of our {appDomain}, but we cannot assure you that we will
                be able to do this in all cases. If you do not challenge the
                disclosure request yourself, we may be legally required to turn
                over your information. The challenge of such overly broad
                requests is inclusive but not limited to denial of information
                basis the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the
                matter of Shreya Singhal v. Union of India; (2015) 5 SCC 1 or
                any other relevant judgment which may be applicable in the facts
                and circumstances of the matter.
